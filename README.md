# Weather-Telegram-Bot

## Aim
The aim of the project is to build a Telegram bot that tells the weather of a city providing users with quick and easy access to up-to-date weather information for any location around the world. This bot is designed to help users plan their day or week, whether they're traveling or simply curious about the weather in a particular city.
The bot uses an API to fetch weather data from reliable sources and provides users with detailed information about temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather parameters for the specified location. 
To use the bot, users simply need to search for [@srkr_weather_bot] in the Telegram app and start a chat. They can then specify the city they are interested in, and the bot will respond with the latest weather data for that location.
